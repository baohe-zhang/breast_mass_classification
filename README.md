Mammography is the process of using low-energy X-rays to examine the human breast for diagnosis and screening. However, the rates of false-negative if the mammograms are relatively high by its manual nature. In this paper, we train multiple Convolution Neural Network-based classifiers to classify pre-segmented breast masses from mammograms as benign or malignant. Our dataset is created by extracting breast mass images from public available mammography dataset CBIS-DDSM. Our best model achieves accuracy of 0.969, recall of 0.947, and precision of 0.985, successfully beating all known prior works and human experts. This result is achieved by a ResNet-18 network with transfer learning. We also conduct visualization with saliency maps to explore how our models classify breast masses. Our result demonstrates that Deep Learning is a powerful tool for breast cancer diagnosis, and it can bring new insights into further clinical trials.
